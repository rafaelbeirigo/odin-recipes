* Introduction
In this project, I am going to build a basic recipe website.

After completing this project I expect to have improved both my HTML and Git skills.

I'll experiment with a new approach in this project, where I plan everything ahead, and only then start programming.

But first let's get the setup done.

** Setup

#+begin_quote
1. Create a new repo for this project on GitHub.com and call it odin-recipes and choose the public option instead of the default private.

2. Clone that repository onto your local machine, inside the repos folder that you previously created in the Git Basics lesson. The command should look like git clone git@github.com:username/odin-recipes.git (use SSH).

3. Now cd into the odin-recipes project directory that is now on your local machine.

4. Set up your README.md file and write a brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what you have learned.)
#+end_quote

** Plan

This is the list of planned commits, in order.
To get here, I first outlined the folder structure, then looked at each file role and related tasks from the project assignment, finally ordered them.
To makes things easier, I prepared all the pages' content ahead of time (recipe stuff kept on the branch dev).

*** TODO feat(home): add index.html
*** TODO feat(home): add html boilerplate

A Taste of Hogwarts

The wizarding world is filled with enchanted feasts and magical sweets, but a few recipes appear again and again in the pages of Harry Potter.
These three recipes capture the essence of Hogwarts dining and Hogsmeade treats: a cozy drink to warm your hands, a portable pastry to snack on during long journeys, and a dessert so good it became Harry’s favorite.
All are adapted for Muggle kitchens, so you can enjoy a bit of Hogwarts magic at home.
#+end_quote
*** for each recipe
**** TODO feat(recipe): add page
**** TODO feat(home): add link to recipe page
#+begin_src html
<a href="recipes/recipename.html">Recipe Name</a>
#+end_src
**** TODO feat(recipe): add html boilerplate
**** TODO feat(recipe): add page title
**** TODO feat(recipe): add main header
**** TODO feat(recipe): add link to home
#+begin_quote
Add a link back to the index page on your recipe page for easier navigation.
You can place this link at the top or bottom of your recipe page (e.g., lasagna.html).
#+end_quote

#+begin_src html
<a href="../index.html">Home</a>
#+end_src
**** TODO feat(recipe): add image
#+begin_quote
A free image of the finished dish under the h1 heading that you added earlier.
#+end_quote
**** TODO feat(recipe): add description
#+begin_quote
Under the image, it should have an appropriately sized “Description” heading followed by a paragraph or two describing the recipe.
#+end_quote
**** TODO feat(recipe): add ingredients
#+begin_quote
Under the description, add an “Ingredients” heading followed by an unordered list of the ingredients needed for the recipe.
#+end_quote
**** TODO feat(recipe): add steps
#+begin_quote
Finally, under the ingredients list, add a “Steps” heading followed by an ordered list of the steps needed for making the dish.
#+end_quote


The plan: do it in the order of the assignment.
I'll be able to reuse the scaffold of the trickiest part, the recipe page.

** Work

*** Homepage
This is the homepage of the website.
It will contain a nice header and links to three recipes.

[[file:index.html][index.html]] ≡

#+begin_src html :tangle index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>My first page from Odin</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>Odin Recipes</h1>
    <<Links to the Recipes>>
  </body>
</html>
#+end_src

*** Recipes
These are the three recipes of the website.

**** Recipe 1
Lasagna!

[[file:recipes/lasagna.html][recipes/lasagna.html]] ≡

#+begin_src html :tangle recipes/lasagna.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>My first page from Odin</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>Lasagna</h1>
    <<Link to the homepage>>
  </body>
</html>
#+end_src

Add a link for this recipe on the homepage.

~<<Links to the Recipes>> +≡~

#+begin_src html :noweb-ref Links to the Recipes
<a href="./recipes/lasagna.html">Lasagna</a>
#+end_src

Now a link to the homepage on the recipe page.
We'll use this same snippet for all three recipe pages.

~<<Link to the homepage>> +≡~

#+begin_src html :noweb-ref Link to the homepage
<a href="../index.html">Home</a>
#+end_src
