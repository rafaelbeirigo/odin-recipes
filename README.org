* Introduction
In this project, I am going to build a basic recipe website.

After completing this project I expect to have improved both my HTML and Git skills.

I'll experiment with a new approach in this project, where I plan ahead all the commits, and only then start programming.
Let's see how it goes.

** Plan

This is the list of planned commits, in order.
To get here, I first outlined the folder structure, then looked at each file role and related tasks from the project assignment, and finally ordered them.
To makes things easier, I also prepared all the recipes pages' content (research work) ahead of time.

  A Taste of Hogwarts

  The wizarding world is filled with enchanted feasts and magical sweets, but a few recipes appear again and again in the pages of Harry Potter.
  These three recipes capture the essence of Hogwarts dining and Hogsmeade treats: a cozy drink to warm your hands, a portable pastry to snack on during long journeys, and a dessert so good it became Harry’s favorite.
  All are adapted for Muggle kitchens, so you can enjoy a bit of Hogwarts magic at home.

** Work
This project is done in Literate Programming, with Babel, from Org Mode, in Emacs.

We start with the homepage.
The recipes are themed on Hogwarts!

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Treacle Tart, Harry Potter’s favorite dessert, is a Hogwarts feast staple.
      Its filling is made with golden syrup (a British caramel-like sweetener), fresh breadcrumbs, and lemon.
      The result is a gooey, sweet, and slightly tangy tart that pairs beautifully with cream.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 9-inch pre-baked tart shell (shortcrust pastry)</li>
      <li>1 ¼ cups golden syrup (or substitute with light corn syrup + honey)</li>
      <li>2 tbsp fresh breadcrumbs</li>
      <li>2 tbsp lemon juice</li>
      <li>Zest of 1 lemon</li>
      <li>1 egg (beaten)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
      <li>Warm the golden syrup until pourable.</li>
      <li>Mix in breadcrumbs, lemon juice, zest, and beaten egg.</li>
      <li>Pour filling into the tart shell and spread evenly.</li>
      <li>Bake 25–30 minutes, until set and lightly golden.</li>
