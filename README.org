* Introduction
In this project, I am going to build a basic recipe website.

After completing this project I expect to have improved both my HTML and Git skills.

I'll experiment with a new approach in this project, where I plan everything ahead, and only then start programming.

But first let's get the setup done.

** Setup

#+begin_quote
1. Create a new repo for this project on GitHub.com and call it odin-recipes and choose the public option instead of the default private.

2. Clone that repository onto your local machine, inside the repos folder that you previously created in the Git Basics lesson. The command should look like git clone git@github.com:username/odin-recipes.git (use SSH).

3. Now cd into the odin-recipes project directory that is now on your local machine.

4. Set up your README.md file and write a brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what you have learned.)
#+end_quote

** Plan

This is the list of planned commits, in order.
To get here, I first outlined the folder structure, then looked at each file role and related tasks from the project assignment, finally ordered them.
To makes things easier, I prepared all the pages' content ahead of time (recipe stuff kept on the branch dev).

A Taste of Hogwarts

The wizarding world is filled with enchanted feasts and magical sweets, but a few recipes appear again and again in the pages of Harry Potter.
These three recipes capture the essence of Hogwarts dining and Hogsmeade treats: a cozy drink to warm your hands, a portable pastry to snack on during long journeys, and a dessert so good it became Harry’s favorite.
All are adapted for Muggle kitchens, so you can enjoy a bit of Hogwarts magic at home.
