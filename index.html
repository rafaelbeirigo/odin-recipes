    <h1>Odin Recipes</h1>
    <h2>A Taste of Hogwarts</h2>

    <p>
      The wizarding world is filled with enchanted feasts and magical sweets, but a few recipes appear again and again in the pages of Harry Potter.
      These three recipes capture the essence of Hogwarts dining and Hogsmeade treats: a cozy drink to warm your hands, a portable pastry to snack on during long journeys, and a dessert so good it became Harryâ€™s favorite.
      All are adapted for Muggle kitchens, so you can enjoy a bit of Hogwarts magic at home.
